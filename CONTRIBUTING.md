# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure your submission is not a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Adhere to the table formatting (namely keep to the alphabetical order by category,name), which makes for easier reading. I've pasted a snippet of the structure to be completed for each record below.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thanks for your suggestions!
